I was the lead developer for the initial phase of the YVR Digital Twin project.  During this phase of the project we created a 2D view of the entire airport and a 3D view of the new Phase D expansion at YVR.  The 2D view incorporated data from an Azure backend.  This provided live data for flight schedules, check point wait times, people counts at areas of interest and more.  The 3D view was a proof of concept developed to explore how a 3D digital twin could function.

As lead developer, my role in the project was to oversee the developers, and work with the client and project manager to plan features and develop tasks.  I also designed and implemented an interface between the app and the Azure backend to handle API calls through OpenAPI and live updates through SignalR.
