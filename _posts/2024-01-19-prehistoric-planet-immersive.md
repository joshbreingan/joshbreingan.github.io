As part of the Unity Film team, I developed and improved the render farm tools used to create this film.  This involved both developing tools in C# for the Unity Engine and in Python for AWS Thinkbox Deadline. 

#### [Prehistoric Planet Immersive](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/prehistoric-planet-immersive/umc.cmc.4llk93xln0cw9wrwbmfduwbdx?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000) on Apple TV+ for the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/)

Inspired by the award-winning Apple Original docuseries from Favreau and the producers of Planet Earth, “Prehistoric Planet Immersive” is a new film that whisks viewers along a rugged ocean coast where a pterosaur colony settles in for an afternoon nap — one that proves to be anything but restful. Viewers will transport into the daily lives of dinosaurs, experiencing T-Rex teens crashing a quiet colony of pterosaurs on the beach until mama shows up to break up their party, and an intense battle between raptors and a pride of Triceratops in the forest.

One of the first Apple Immersive Videos available at the launch of the Apple Vision Pro.  The film was rendered in 180-degree 8K 3D format using the Unity Engine.
